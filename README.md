# LMSDB
The Library Management System Database (LMSDB) is designed to maintain information about the books in the library, their authors, the members to whom books are issued, and the library staff. This project utilized the system to record various transactions, such as issuing and returning books, updating book information, and adding new members. This system allows both students and the library manager, to keep a constant track of all available books. I created different entity sets and established connections between them, enabling me to determine the cardinality and types of relationships between the entity sets. As a result, I successfully generated SQL queries and implemented various complex conditions to assess their efficiency.
